        <p>
            For this project, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requested we aid them with their technical debt. Technical debt is
            essentially the consequence of developers delivering speedy code over quality code. Over time, this 'bad' code breaks down, and
            companies must decide if they should pay the cost of refactoring it. The FAA asked us to help them find ways to manage
            their technical debt, measure it, and compare it to other similar organizations. This could give them a baseline to figure out if
            their technical debt hinders their operations. For this project, we were asked to investigate their three main forms of technical debt
            by studying other organizations and their methods employed to deal with it. Furthermore, we explored existing third-party solutions as
            well as industry best practices.

        <p>
            For this project, my team and I were given the task of creating a database for a fake company, Sonner Tire.
            To accomplish this, we made a conceptual, logical, and physical design and then implemented it using SQL Server.
            Some requirements of this project included designing an ERD, conducting normalization and denormalization, making a data dictionary,
            creating our ERD tables in SQL Server, loading data into our tables, then conducting SQL query analysis to answer questions for the client.
        </p>
        <p>This is the ERD we designed:</p>

            Next is a screenshot of SQL Server. It shows how we created the table 'TCar' and then how we loaded our data into the table.
            In the Object Explorer tab to the left, some of our other tables are also visible, such as 'TManufacturer' & 'TEmployee'.

        <p>
            This project is still in the works. Some requirements of this project include creating an ERD, a DFD (Context, System, and Lower-Levels),
            Proccess Specs, a Data Dictionary, a Data Model, a Dialog Diagram, and a Prototype.
