        <p id="aboutfont">Throughout my college career, I found myself struggling to decide what I wanted to major in. My freshman year at UCO, it was engineering 
        because I am good at Math. That is when I was first introduced to coding. Although I found it extremely difficult at first, once I
        got the basics down I really started to enjoy it. Then, I transferred to OU and decided the science aspect of engineering was not for me, so
        I switched to accounting. That is when I was introduced to MIS. I had already found an interest in business, so I realized that MIS is a
        perfect fit. It would allow me to have an opportunity to code in addition to performing other business-related functions. With that being
        said, I am most definitely looking forward to the next chapter in my life. </p>
